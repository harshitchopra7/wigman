## Project Overview

This repository is my submission for the Wingman Coding Challenge for the Frontend Engineering Role. The goal was to create a pixel-perfect, responsive implementation of the provided Figma design using modern technologies, adhering to best practices in code quality and structure.

The app simulates a live shopping assistance platform, showcasing my ability to build scalable, user-friendly frontend interfaces.

## Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: Faithfully reproduced the Figma design with exact spacing, colors, and layout.
- **Responsive UI**: Ensures seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Mock API Data**: Used mock data closely mimicking real-world API responses to populate the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Implemented efficient and scalable styling.
- **Sorting**: Interactive table sorting for better usability.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently handles large datasets with server-like pagination.

### Bonus Features

- Sorting by multiple table columns.
- Pagination integrated with mock data to simulate real-world scenarios.
